## 降临 | R. S. 托马斯

在神的掌心中 
握着一小球

“看” 祂说 
于是神之子也看这小球

远方 
仿佛在水面下 
有焦黢的大地 
是灼烈的色彩

光明在那里熊熊燃烧 
结黑痂的楼房 
投下阴影

蛇蟒 
河流将自己舒展解散 
闪动着稠腻的光芒

荒芜的起伏 
枯枝老虬 
黯淡了天空

许多人类
瘦弱的手臂 
就举向那里 
仿佛在等待已逝去的四月 
回归它的交错 
枝头

神之子注视着这一切

“愿吾往” 
他这样说

## The Coming
And God held in his hand
A small globe. Look he said.
The son looked. Far off,
As through water, he saw
A scorched land of fierce
Colour. The light burned
There; crusted buildings
Cast their shadows: a bright
Serpent, a river
Uncoiled itself, radiant
With slime.
                        On a bare
Hill a bare tree saddened
The sky. Many People
Held out their thin arms
To it, as though waiting
For a vanished April
To return to its crossed
Boughs. The son watched
Them. Let me go there, he said.
